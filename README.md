# phys-clust

This is a collection of files needed to conduct the statistical analysis in 
Hwang, Y., Wright, S., and Hanlon, B. (2017). Estimation and Testing Problems in Auditory Neuroscience via Clustering. *Biometrics*,  **73**, 1010-1017.

Hopefully I can spend some more time on this project to create a stand-alone package for better reproducibility.
