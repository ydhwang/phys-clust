# physclust

This is a collection of files needed to conduct the statistical analysis in 

- Hwang, Y., Wright, S., and Hanlon, B. (2017). Estimation and Testing Problems in Auditory Neuroscience via Clustering. *Biometrics*,  **73**, 1010-1017.
- Wright, S., Hwang, Y., Oertel, D. (2014) Synaptic transmission between end bulbs of Held and bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus of mice with a mutation in Otoferlin. *Journal of Neurophysiology*, **112**, 3173-3188.

Hopefully I can spend some more time on this project to create a stand-alone package for better reproducibility.
